`run.sh` merely launches the dataset downloading and benchmarking scripts. No command line args, all configs are set in `config.py`. I wanted to keep the dataset pure dask, but had problems getting the LabelEncoder from dask to work and spent way too much time on it and and gave up. Didn't want to overengineer so didn't use any OOP, and since we're comparing two implementations of the same XGBRegressor even the hyperparameter dictionary is shared. I could load the whole dataset in memory and work with it, but to play with a higher number of workers I decided to subsample.
